# springboot-encyclopedia-project

This server currently doesn't have a frontend anymore, so don't try to run it with reactjs-encyclopedia-project because it's not going to work.
Instead, the frontend works with my node express server.

I will update this code in the future. Until then, you can check out my superior https://github.com/thisisnothappening/nodejs-encyclopedia-project.
